# AI Criteria System Migration Summary

## Overview
Successfully migrated from strict AI exception rules to a more nuanced additional criteria system to improve AI accuracy while maintaining relevance filtering.

## Changes Made

### 1. Configuration Updates
- **File**: `config/config.json`
- **Change**: Replaced `ai_exception_rules` with `additional_ai_criteria`
- **Impact**: More nuanced criteria that provide "benefit of the doubt" approach

### 2. OpenAI Utilities Updates
- **File**: `src/integrations/openai_utils.py`
- **Changes**:
  - Updated `_analyzeWithAI` function to use `additional_ai_criteria` instead of `ai_exception_rules`
  - Replaced `_checkExceptionRules` function with `_checkAdditionalCriteria` function
  - Changed logic from exclusion-based to criteria-based refinement
  - Updated prompts to focus on ALL criteria being met rather than ANY exception applying

### 3. Message Processor Updates
- **File**: `src/core/message_processor.py`
- **Changes**:
  - Updated function call from `_checkExceptionRules` to `_checkAdditionalCriteria`
  - Changed variable names from `exception_rules` to `additional_criteria`
  - Updated logging to reflect new criteria-based approach

## Key Behavioral Changes

### Before (Exception Rules)
- Messages were EXCLUDED if they matched ANY exception rule
- Binary exclusion approach: match = exclude, no match = include
- Could result in overly aggressive filtering

### After (Additional Criteria)
- Messages must meet ALL additional criteria to remain significant
- Nuanced evaluation approach with detailed reasoning
- "Benefit of the doubt" when unclear
- More conservative filtering that preserves borderline relevant content

## Benefits of New System

1. **Improved Accuracy**: Less aggressive filtering reduces false negatives
2. **Better Context Awareness**: Criteria require comprehensive evaluation
3. **Flexible Refinement**: Can adjust criteria without changing core logic
4. **Clearer Reasoning**: AI provides detailed explanations for decisions
5. **Maintainable**: Easier to tune criteria based on real-world performance

## Iraq-Specific Criteria
The new system includes comprehensive criteria specifically designed for Iraq relevance:
- Geographic specificity requirements
- Political context awareness
- Economic relevance checks
- Security and conflict considerations
- Social and cultural impact evaluation

## Migration Status
✅ **Complete** - All references to `ai_exception_rules` and `_checkExceptionRules` have been removed
✅ **Tested** - Code compiles without errors
✅ **Ready** - System ready for testing with improved AI accuracy

## Next Steps
1. Test the new criteria system with sample messages
2. Monitor AI accuracy improvements
3. Fine-tune criteria based on performance
4. Update documentation and guides as needed
